Create your tests here.

Tips:
 - You can look at src/examples for inspiration
 - Use 'assert' to compare a fixture with the output of a method.
 - The test data (fixtures) are located in conftest.py, methods and fixtures in
   conftest are automatically initialized when running a test with pytest.
   The fixtures are available under their function name.
